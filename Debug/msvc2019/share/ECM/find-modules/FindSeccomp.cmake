# FindSeccomp
# -----------
#
# Try to locate the libseccomp library.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``Seccomp_FOUND``
#     True if the seccomp library is available
# ``Seccomp_INCLUDE_DIRS``
#     The seccomp include directories
# ``Seccomp_LIBRARIES``
#     The seccomp libraries for linking
#
# If ``Seccomp_FOUND`` is TRUE, it will also define the following
# imported target:
#
# ``Seccomp::Seccomp``
#     The Seccomp library
#
# Since 5.44.0.
